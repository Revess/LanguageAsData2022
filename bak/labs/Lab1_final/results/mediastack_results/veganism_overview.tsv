Having never travelled to Pakistan and failing to learn my relatives’ language, it offered a taste of understanding. Traditional sheikh kebabs, masala spiced fish, or lamb keema curries were swapped between my extended family members as weekly markers of affection, each dish a tiny lesson on our history. The flavours were an expression of my ancestors’ lives and identities, laid out on a plate and recipes, long ago perfected, were passed down from one generation to the next. So, when I decided to adopt a plant-based diet after taking part in the annual Veganuary campaign three years ago, I had a problem more complicated than simply avoiding dairy or eggs: I could no longer eat the foods that had tied me to my heritage. Veganuary started as a bit of fun. A challenge spurred on by curiosity, to see if I could really go a month without melting cheese over jacket potatoes and persevere, despite my fantasies of thick cream layered desserts. But once I started to look into the benefits of veganism, I found it hard to go back. Sucked in by the documentaries, the carefully constructed vegan Instagrams, and the news that a plant-based diet was one of the best things I could do for the planet – a month after avoiding all temptation, I was sold. I felt my skin clearing up. I discovered I appreciated the added veggies in my diet, and with the knowledge of its ethical and environmental merits, I was even gifted a secret sense of fulfilment. What was not to like? Well, according to my family, a lot of things. Though I’d dabbled in pescetarianism years before, when I announced my decision to go fully vegan, I was met with everything from a complete lack of understanding of what being vegan actually meant, to a constant stream of ‘but why?’s. My relatives couldn’t fathom why I’d optionally push aside the food my grandma had spent hours cooking and were filled with worry that I wasn’t fuelling my body correctly. Worse than their response, however, was my own creeping sense that by going vegan, I would never feel properly connected to our culture again. Swept up by how good going plant-based was making me feel, I never stopped to consider how it might affect that part of my life. Having made the decision to try to make my veganism permanent, doubts lingered, and once I was with my extended family they were hard to ignore. The food of Pakistan isn’t entirely focused on meat, fish and dairy, but compared to other South Asian cuisines, the ingredients are much more dominant and there were times I felt left out. At family weddings, I had to skip courses – side dishes became my only option. While others celebrated, I felt disheartened that I couldn’t properly join in with the fun. I watched in envy as others sipped on lassis, a traditional yoghurt drink, at restaurant meals. I was embarrassed each time I had to ask a relative who had spent hours preparing a feast if their food was vegan friendly and felt a rising awkwardness as I whispered to explain that they’d accidentally added an ingredient that I couldn’t eat. But of course, it was my choice and I was unwilling to give it up – so instead, I set out to find ways to incorporate the taste of Pakistan into my diet. To my own shame, before going vegan I never really attempted to make the food of my culture – I didn’t think I could do it justice, so I didn’t try. But with the desire to remain connected, I started to try out the recipes I’d always enjoyed. Ingredients to traditional daals and aloo gobi became regulars on my shopping lists, and with the assistance of meat replacements, I began developing my own vegan versions of classics I thought no longer would be an option. Tofu replaced lamb in biryanis, I added fake chicken to karahi curries and even tried making a vegan mince kebab. The feedback from my family was positive – my relatives were just pleased I was trying to recreate the tastes of our homeland, even without the meat. Though there are still times I long for the comfort of the food I grew up eating, cooking my own take on national delicacies has meant in some ways, I’m more immersed in the flavours of Pakistan than ever before. Over time my family have adapted to my diet. They try to eat mainly vegan food when I visit, and we’ve found variations on recipes that we can all enjoy together, but I’m lucky that they’ve been so accommodating. My decision to go plant-based is definitely not the norm. The rise of veganism is largely connected with those who are white and privileged, and among British Pakistani families, it is basically unheard of. Our food is so intrinsically tied to our culture that making wholesale change is more difficult than a few little swaps and alternatives. It can mean an identity shift and with so many choices off the menu, I’ve had to work hard to find worthy substitutes to culinary favourites and ask more questions about my family history to not feel like I’ve abandoned my roots. It hasn’t always been easy – in my first year of going vegan, I slipped up a few times around my family, too tempted by things like buttered-smothered naan. On other occasions I just avoided asking questions about what ingredients went into certain meals – what you don’t know, doesn’t count, right? However, for people of colour especially, it’s important not to punish ourselves too much. Trying to balance veganism with culture is a difficult task. I’ll always feel guilty that I haven’t learnt my ancestors’ recipes and that, as a result, part of our family history might be lost with me. Yet if veganism has taught me anything about food, it is that old recipes are ever-evolving. I now hope that one day, it could be my vegan versions that will be passed down to the generations to come. Do you have a story you’d like to share? Get in touch by emailing jess.austin@metro.co.uk.

2021-10-31	05:30:19+00:00	https://www.theguardian.com/profile/funmi-fetto	The best new fragrances | Funmi Fetto	https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/oct/31/the-best-new-fragrances	We are fast approaching that time of the year when we should all be getting our proverbials in gear and begin gift-planning. Scent is an easy place to start. I know giving fragrances, while not as unimaginative as vouchers, can seem lazy, but the fragrances on this page all tap into something that goes beyond “Oh, that smells nice!” Chloé’s new iteration of their modern classic scent is now vegan – as are all Aesop’s fragrances – and a significant portion of the packaging has been created with reclaimed materials. The launch of Jo Malone London’s English Pear and Freesia saw the brand supporting the National Trust to restore these fruit trees and plant hundreds more. Gabar is a brilliant new brand created by two Myanmar-born women, and a chunk of the proceeds will go towards rebuilding their home country. (Byredo also taps into its own founder’s heritage with Mumbai Noise.) Nue Co’s Mind Energy uses olfactory technology and upcycled extracts in an effort to boost mental agility; while Estée Lauder’s luxe scent range – there are eight in the collection – underwent a neuroscensorial test that showed it elicited a spectrum of positive moods, including confidence and happiness. And let’s not underestimate the power of optics: the pared-down cool of Loewe, the grown-up chic of Givenchy and the unapologetically floral Gucci Gardenia… Beautiful concoctions, yes, but even looking at the bottles will bring you joy. 1.

The Deshmukhs have been developing plant-based meat alternatives under their Imagine Meat label. PETA, a global animal rights organisation, has been campaigning for people to switch over to a vegan diet. The other winners ranged from Sofit soy milk to Haldiram’s ‘soan papdi’, besides a vegan cheese, mayonnaise and even ghee. The online store Vegan Dukan was also among the honourees. PETA announced the awards ahead of World Vegan Day and World Vegan Month. In a statement, it stated that 63 percent of Indians are inclined to replace meats with plant-based options and 75 percent are unable to digest milk properly. “From creamy, dairy-free chocolate ice-cream to meat-free chicken, all these innovative foods are making it easy for people to pamper their taste buds without harming animals,” says PETA India`s vegan foods and nutrition specialist, Dr Kiran Ahuja.

Madelaine Vikse , Assistant Lifestyle EditorOctober 29, 2021 Since skin is the largest organ of the human body, it is essential to take care of it. When thinking about skin care, it can be for appearances, but it is also important for one’s health. In order to have a good skin care routine, it is crucial that the products being used are ethically made and of good quality ingredients. Here is a list of the top 5 best brands that are 100% cruelty-free and vegan. Pacifica sells skin care, makeup, perfume and hair care products. The brand carries many kinds of face wash, moisturizers and serums. “Many Pacifica skincare products contain antioxidant vitamins C and E. Antioxidants protect the skin against free radical damage,” according to The Derm Review. Pacifica’s best product is the Ceramide Extra Gentle Face Wash. This face wash leaves the skin feeling hydrated rather than dried out and is fragrance-free, which is perfect for those with sensitive skin. Truly has a wide range of skin care products for the whole body, and the brand is advertised a lot through Instagram. The most effective product from Truly has to be its CBD Jelly Anti-Blemish Facial Serum.

The brand, which started with solely selling makeup, has affordable skin care products that are good quality, as well as being vegan and cruelty-free. The best product from e.l.f has to be the fragrance-free Holy Hydration! Face Cream, which is especially good for sensitive skin, as most fragrance-free products are.

Niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3 and can help treat acne, increase hydration and reduce redness and inflammation, according to DermNet NZ. There are so many different brands and kinds of face masks available to choose from, but the face masks from Vitamasques are next level. The face masks are fruit-themed and are incredibly hydrating. The brand, based in the United Kingdom, takes inspiration from K-beauty brands for its skin care products, according to the Vitamasques website. Weekly horoscopes: Oct. 27 – Nov. 2
2021-10-29	15:08:00+00:00	PR Newswire	Climate Change Improvements From Eating Less Meat	https://www.thestreet.com/press-releases/climate-change-improvements-from-eating-less-meat-15815792	 BETHESDA, Md., Oct. 29, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Not everyone needs to be a vegan to help combat climate change, but reducing meat consumption is both good for the planet and good for individual health, according to two national/international groups creating awareness of climate change impacts related to food consumption, as well as advocating for fair treatment of animals. While the intersection of climate impacts with eating meat at one time seemed tenuous, recent studies by climate scientists have made it abundantly clear that livestock production is a major contributor to world greenhouse gas emissions, emerging as a bigger threat than fossil fuel use for transportation. Also, the resources livestock farming take is not efficient to feed the world's population: animal agriculture uses 80% of global land (non-sea) but only provides 20% of the world's calories. The costs in food, water, land needed and land and climate degradation must be examined and understood, because scientists say it is not sustainable to continue deforesting our planet to produce limited food (meat) for rich nations, all the while creating huge greenhouse gas emissions, said Sustainable Earth Eating. According to University of Illinois scientists, livestock production, which includes food grown to feed livestock, creates 57 percent of global Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GGEs). Xiaoming Xu and Atul K. Jain are the two lead scientists who recently reported their findings in the academic Journal Nature Food (7/23/2021). Some industry leaders count it even higher. Pat Brown, CEO and founder of Impossible Foods, a plant-based meat company, has said livestock farming, including food to feed livestock, and related emissions from related transportation are 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions in a recent interview. Livestock production emits three gases toxic to our climate: carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Methane is known to be 8 X as potent as carbon dioxide and stays in the atmosphere longer. Research shows that 15 X more protein can be produced on any given area of land with plants, rather than cows. (FAO UN) Most of members of FARM supporters stopped eating meat due to maltreatment and cruelty to animals, including factory farming, said Eric Lindstrom, Executive Director of Farm Animal Rights Movement. He said they have 1 million supporters worldwide. Some vegans stopped eating meat for health reasons, as the China Study, written by a doctor/son of a cattle rancher, found meat to be the cause of many heart problems that were abated or cured when meat and dairy were eliminated from patients' diet, according to Jane DeMarines, SEE executive director. Vegan Jane Goodall: window closing on climate change.Famed naturalist: "We've got the solutions to all these problems. There are amazing ways to restore fertility to overused farmland, also …banning the factory farming of animals. We know how to improve biodiversity and health of soil. We've got a window of time to do these…, but it's not a big window, and it is closing, "( Wash.Post. (10/26/21) Beatles icon Paul McCartney in 2009 started "Meatless Mondays," an effort that continues and also operates in the U.S. Ideas to chip away and reduce global meat eating is one of the fastest ways to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions environmentalists say. If everyone began to skip one day per week of eating meat, it would create a massive global effect. With better agriculture and replacing meat with plant-based proteins SEE and FARM believe we can back-up the measured hope that naturalists such as Jane Goodall express. Farm Animal Rights Movement (FARM) is a national nonprofit organization advocating for animal rights and veganism since 1976. For many years, FARM was the only national animal rights organization fighting for farmed animals. For more information, visit farmusa.org . PO Box 4064 | Ithaca NY 14852 | 888.FARMUSA Sustainable Earth Eating (SEE) www.sustainableeartheating.org was formed in 2021 to elevate awareness of meat production impacts on climate change and promote reduced meat consumption.

2021-10-29	14:30:15+00:00	Gayle Rouncivell	Young Lancaster University entrepreneur launches 'broken biscuit box' to mark World Vegan Day	https://www.thevisitor.co.uk/news/people/young-lancaster-university-entrepreneur-launches-broken-biscuit-box-to-mark-world-vegan-day-3437077	The green tech firm was set up by Lancaster University student James Eid back with the launch of the UK’s first ‘wonky bread’ box back in March. Earth & Wheat’s mission is to reduce food waste at the point of production and ‘rescue’ baked goods which would otherwise have been binned due to its odd size or unattractive appearance. Young entrepreneur James, 20, a fourth-generation baker at family-owned business, Signature Flatbreads, sold more than 10,000 bread box boxes in the first 12 weeks and has so far saved more than 200 tonnes of bread from going to waste. Now Earth & Launch is preparing to add to its product range with the launch of its new broken biscuit box on the same day World Vegan Day - an annual event celebrated by vegans around the world. The launch also coincides with COP26 – the UN Climate Change Conference being held in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12. The 1.8kg box will contain a mixed selection of six types of broken sweet and savoury biscuits including cookies, gem, gingerbread, crackers and water biscuits. James said: “I’m very excited about the launch of our new Earth & Wheat vegan wonky broken biscuit box as we continue in our fight to reduce food waste and save the planet. “Around 16 per cent of food wasted is at the point of production and our mission is to to end food waste at the production stage before it even reaches the supermarket shelves. It is this invisible waste that we don’t see every day that we want to stop. “We started with the launch of our ‘wonky’ bread box earlier this year and now the time is right to introduce our new wonky broken biscuit box as part of the next step in Earth & Wheat’s journey to reduce food waste. “Each biscuit will be deemed to be imperfect that it cannot be sold in supermarkets as normal, such as it will have a wonky shape, an odd pattern, or a crumbled corner. “But Earth & Wheat biscuits will still taste just as delicious as they would normally and will be fun for all the family to enjoy. The best part of it is our customers will be doing their bit for the environment by reducing food waste.” As with the bread boxes, customers will be able to subscribe to the Earth & Wheat at biscuit box on a weekly, fortnightly, every three weeks, or monthly basis for £7.99 including delivery. World Vegan Day was established in 1994 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of The Vegan Society and the coining of the terms, ‘vegan’ and ‘veganism’.
2021-10-29	12:36:23+00:00	https://www.facebook.com/CyprusMail	Animal Party hosting vegan event in central Nicosia on Sunday	https://cyprus-mail.com/2021/10/29/animal-party-hosting-vegan-event-in-central-nicosia-on-sunday/	The Animal Party on Friday invited consumers to question behaviours responsible for the abuse of millions of animals and try vegan foods this weekend. In a statement announcing the coming event marking World Vegan Day, the party invited the public to “do something different” this Sunday, “even out of curiosity”. People will have the opportunity to try vegan foods, learn vegan recipes and products and get informed about veganism at 11am on Ledras and Onasagorou pedestrian streets, the party said. The open invitation included the president, speaker of parliament, ministers, party leaders, house representatives and everyone who lives and works in the country. Referring to people who eat meat, the party called on consumers to “challenge, reconsider and reject” behaviours that they used to consider “natural” and “necessary” but which are responsible for the “abuse and misery of millions of animals on our planet”. From a young age, humans are taught that animals exist to serve humans, without considering what that really means, and we continue to exterminate them en masse every year, the party said. Consumption of animal products is based on violence and animal abuse, while it negatively affects the environment and burdens the quality of human life, it added. According to (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) PETA “globally, animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gases than all the world’s transportation systems combined”. The coronavirus pandemic, which the entire humanity is still fighting today, is the result of human manipulation of other species, the party said citing scientific findings to date. “So, we change our eating habits and by choosing vegetarianism we will be able to reduce environmental damage and eliminate bad habits that burden human, animals, and nature,” the announcement added. The chairman of the environment committee and leader of the Green party Charalambos Theopemptou will address the event. For more information contact 70078080.
2021-10-29	03:27:54+00:00		Western Market Food Hall Brings New Food Offerings to Foggy Bottom Community	https://thehoya.com/western-market-food-hall-brings-new-food-offerings-to-foggy-bottom-community/	October 28, 2021 by Eli Blumenfeld Leave a Comment Four new establishments have opened in the Western Market Food Hall since September as part of the building’s continued redevelopment and renovation. Western Market, a public food space located on The George Washington University’s (GWU) main campus, opened in late September with the four offerings: RAWish, a vegan vendor; Roaming Rooster, a fried chicken restaurant; Capo Deli, a sandwich place; and Mason’s Famous Lobster Rolls, a lobster and seafood shop. The market additionally plans to open four stalls later this fall, with four more coming in the winter. According to Tim Hill, vice president of investments for MidAtlantic Realty Partners (MRP) and the developer for Western Market, the combination of different types of vendors was important for the vision for the space. “We wanted a really eclectic mix of vendors, in terms of price point, regions and health,” Hill said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We really thought carefully about getting the balance right so that we have a really healthy blend here.” Housed in a market building constructed in 1802, Western Market features patio seating, socially distanced seating options and large open spaces. Michael Habtemariam, co-owner of Roaming Rooster, chose to open his fourth location in Western Market because of past success in the area. “We started out as a food truck, and our food truck used to come by GW and used to do really, really good,” Habtemariam said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “A lot of the students liked our food, so I think it’s a prime location for us.” According to James Yarborough, co-owner of RAWish, the students and The George Washington University Hospital community will enjoy the type of food that RAWish offers. “I think particularly with the campus community, the younger population is tending to focus on healthy eating in general, and plant based makes up a decent percentage of that,” Yarborough said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Also being near a hospital, that tends to have a population that wants to eat healthy.” Aside from various food options, Western Market hopes to offer other community bonding activities like yoga classes and wine tastings, according to Hill. “We are focused on getting the rest of the retailers that we’ve leased to open,” Hill said. “We’re also continuously filling out our events calendar and creating different ways to bring people to the market to build a community here.” Recent events offered by Western Market include movie nights, live music on the patio, yoga and wine nights. All events were open to the public, though visitors were required to comply with local COVID-19 guidelines, according to Western Market’s website. With all the food options and events at Western Market, Habtemariam hopes that students will continue to support Western Market as the food market continues to expand. “I think it’ll be a really good spot for students to come out and try a different variety of foods,” Habtemariam said. “Once everything is open, it is going to be a good deal.” Upcoming openings this fall and winter include Greek street food restaurant Alitiko, Guatemalan street food restaurant Nim Ali, Venezuelan restaurant Arepa Zone, Southeast Asian restaurant Bandoola Bowl and Japanese restaurant Sushi Onkei. Although Western Market is located in Foggy Bottom, it is a space where people from all over the District, including Georgetown University, can gather, according to Yarborough. “We’re really looking forward to partnering with the Georgetown community,” Yarborough said. “We’re not that far from Georgetown, so we hope to get kids who come over for a break from their usual dining options.” According to Hill, Western Market provides delicious food options and a perfect setting to build community in Foggy Bottom. “We want a group of customers to come, and everyone can get something that they love and then meet up at a table, hang out and spend the afternoon there,” Hill said. 
2021-10-29	02:11:41+00:00	Cheyanne M. Daniels	Chicago-based vegan brand looks to ‘feed the world’ with new product	https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/10/28/22751511/natures-fynd-lightfoot-world-business-chicago-back-of-the-yards-vegan-vegetarian	Nature’s Fynd announced their partnership with grocery chain Mariano’s on Thursday, promising healthier, less-processed vegan options for shoppers. The Union Stockyards on the South Side had defined Chicago as the “hog butcher to the world.” Now, 50 years after its closing, the “Yards” will once again be a manufacturing haven — of a fungi-based protein. The protein Fy was created by Nature’s Fynd. And on Thursday, the company announced it’s bringing the product to Chicagoans in a partnership with Mariano’s grocery stores, along with a 200,000-foot addition of manufacturing space to come in 2022. “It’s great to be part of this revival of food in Chicago, to bring new technology literally where the technology was, and to do that in a way that really uses a fraction of the resources,” said Thomas Jonas, Nature’s Fynd co-founder and CEO. For Jonas, Nature’s Fynd’s origins are part of what distinguishes its breakfast sandwiches and dairy-free products from plant-based protein sources. “We started as a research project for NASA on extreme quality of life,” said Jonas. “The goal was to understand what life on moons of Saturn could look like. Trying to figure that out took us on an exploration journey on the acidic volcanic springs of Yellowstone where we discovered a remarkable new microorganism.” That microorganism led to the invention of a new fermentation process of extracting the protein for Nature’s Fynd’s products. Jonas said this also helps ease concerns in the vegetarian community about over-processed products. For Nature’s Fynd, the company simply extracts the protein from the source and cleans it for use in their foods. “If you pitch this as a movie theme, people would say, ‘No, no that’s too far,’” said Lightfoot, garnering chuckles from Nature’s Fynd employees gathered Thursday. Lightfoot had the chance to taste some of the Fy-based breakfast sandwiches and chocolate mousse at the facility Thursday. “It tastes like a regular breakfast sandwich!” Lightfoot said. As Nature’s Fynd prepares to expand beyond manufacturing and into stores, it’s also preparing to open its additional facility in Back of the Yards. The location at 2075 W. 43rd St. will be an expanded manufacturing and innovation facility, according to Nature’s Fynd’s chief marketing officer, Karuna Rawal, with operations starting in 2022. “This is an expansion of Nature’s Fynd’s commitment and investment in Chicago, especially on our South Side,” said Lightfoot. “As we all know, Chicago’s former Union Stockyards . . . was the epicenter of the 20th century meatpacking industry. Through this innovation and a bit of irony, I must say [Nature’s Fynd is] reinventing the future of food and reclaiming the old stockyards as a future world leader in proteins.” They’re also creating an additional 200 jobs at the new facility — something Lightfoot said is imperative for post-pandemic economic recovery. “We believe in the power of scientific curiosity and human ingenuity,” Jonas said. “And because here in Chicago we make no little plans, we believe with this tiny microbe we can feed the whole world.” The Nature’s Fynd brand is also sold in Berkeley, Calif., and Mariano’s stores in Chicago will start selling it next week.

After falling behind 4-0 on a grand slam by Adam Duvall in the first inning, the Astros turned on the offense in a 9-5 victory. But a UAW strike that began Oct. 14 will continue — and details of the proposed contract will not be released — while workers study the terms of the agreement in advance of a vote. Gunfire erupted early Sunday near a DJ booth that was set up in the backyard of a home, authorities said. Witnesses reported that two gunmen opened fire "from an elevated position on a porch looking down over the crowd" of more than 200 people. Oneta Sampson Carney, 58, allegedly opened fire Saturday evening when a team of thieves stole her Toyota 4Runner as she and her husband were loading groceries in a Sam’s Club parking lot. As two justice-seeking groups of mostly Latino and Black parents memorialize their children for Dia de Los Muertos, they bemoan the lack of support from police, prosecutors and politicians: "The system has failed us in so many ways."

A few weeks ago, it was revealed that Coronation Street, Emmerdale, EastEnders, Hollyoaks, Doctors, Holby City and Casualty will, for the first time ever, join forces and create crossover episodes to tackle climate change. The drama begins on Monday November 1, the same week as World Leaders meet to discuss the climate crisis at the COP26 conference. Over in Walford, in the café, Bailey is trying to convince Karen to go vegan. Karen tries to persuade her to hold off for burger night. Gray (Toby-Alexander Smith), listening in, realises Karen is planning on going to the same restaurant he works in. The next day, Kim (Tameka Empson) and Tiff (Maisie Smith) all find themselves working on projects to promote sustainability and climate change awareness. Rocky (Brian Conley) realises Peter’s (Dayle Hudson) new vegan product range is a hit and pitches him the idea of investing in his meat-free meat business. No, really! If Karen gets word of this project, could it be the push she needs to become vegan and impress Bailey?

It’s not. In fact, it’s Naik’s debut, a bold, effervescent reflection of the self-taught Dish It Healthy host’s two biggest passions: cooking and travel. The Modern Tiffin offers practical guidance and plenty of insight into Chef Pri herself, as the upbeat rising food star guides us through 55 mouth-watering recipes that showcase the global vegan experience. Across eleven chapters, Chef Pri shares food from some of her favorite regions across Mexico, Australia, the United States, Thailand, and more. But the recipes are also often infused with her own unique, Indian-inspired twists — creating a fun fusion that doesn’t obsess over remaining loyal to traditional recipes. The case against veganism has always been that it doesn’t feature enough umami — that unctuous, rich, savory “fifth taste” — but Chef Pri’s book and recipes make a mockery of that outdated notion. So naturally, we had to hit her up for some advice we could apply when cooking our own dishes. Check her tips, below. Before we get into some tips, can you run us through the cool concept behind The Modern Tiffin? It’s a true culmination of my life. I am first generation Indian American, I’ve traveled fairly extensively to about 40 countries globally. The Modern Tiffin really brings together those two aspects of my life… The concept of a Tiffin, which is Indian, is woven through the whole book. A Tiffin is basically a two to three, sometimes four or five layered, steel stacked portable food container, and it’s usually used to take food to lunch. The concept of that really resonated with me, because when I was younger — born and raised in NYC — my mom would pack lunches for my sister and me every day to school and we were made fun of all the time because obviously, we looked different, our food looked different, smelled different… but for me, it was very comforting. It was a way for me to stay connected to my family at home and my family in India. So I grew up with the concept of taking lunch to school every day and even into my adult years, when I graduated college and started in the workforce, I would take lunch every single day to work because it was healthier, more economically efficient, and there weren’t very many options for me at lunch because I was vegetarian at the time, and now I’m vegan. There is a lot of value that people can take away from actually cooking for themselves and making things portable and really bringing cooking to the forefront of your life every day. Do you have a favorite food nation? What nation are people sleeping on in terms of cuisine? Actually, it’s Australia, which is one of the last chapters in my book. There are a few reasons it’s one of my favorites. First, a lot of ingredients are indigenous to Australia. Macadamia nuts, for instance, alot of people think they’re from Hawaii, but they’re not, they were brought over from Australia. The variety of cuisine available is just outstanding, I think because of their proximity to Southeast Asia, they have so many types of different cuisines available, from Malaysian to Indonesian, Vietnamese, etcetera, and the quality is stellar. Much better than what you’d find in a place like New York. The third thing is that plant based and vegan options are weaved into the lifestyle there. I’ve never walked into a restaurant and asked a waiter or waitress what the options are for vegan and vegetarians, it’s always available for me. In New York, I still can’t go to every restaurant and eat freely because the concept is still growing here. I absolutely love Australia for those aspects! Let’s get into cooking. Building out the spice rack can be intimdating and costly but it’s essential for good food. What are your spice rack essentials? The five spices you feel people need to stock first? I love this question because I talk about it in my book in the tips and tricks section. Dried spices are incredibly important not just for East Asian cooking but for all cooking. That is singlehandedly one of the ways that helps improve the flavor of cooking to the point that someone won’t miss meat. But my recommendation first and foremost is for people to buy whole spices, not ground spices. Whole spices contain a lot of flavor and natural oils so when you buy spices whole and grind them yourself you’re getting a lot more bang for your buck and a lot more fresh flavor versus buying already ground spices which can go rancid when they sit on a shelf for too long. In terms of the actual spices you should have on your shelf: cumin seeds, coriander seeds, turmeric, which comes in a powder form, you can’t get that whole unless you get it fresh, dried red chilis and whole black peppercorn. For beginners, what recipe from your book do you feel is the most accessible and easy to prepare? Something about The Modern Tiffin, which may throw some people off, is that the list of ingredients will always seem like it’s slightly more intimidating than it is. In Indian cooking, we use a lot of different dry spices and fresh herbs — don’t be intimidated by that. I’m going to suggest you start with Avocado and Spicy Peanut Chutney Toast. It’s avocado toast, so very basic, but the interesting part of this recipe, and why I find it very special is that a lot of people don’t realize that avocado toast is from Bondi Beach, in Australia. It was a staple in that area for a long time and then it made its way to the western world and it’s kind of taken off from there. I’ve experienced the way they eat avocado toast but I certainly thought it could be amped up a bit with a Chef Pri twist. That’s why I’ve paired it with a spicy peanut chutney, which is Indian, from my specific area of India, which is Maharashtrian. It’s a dry peanut chutney, it has peanuts mixed with red chili, cumin, and topped with pomegranate and fresh lemon juice, and black pepper. It’s simple, you can make the components ahead of time and you can even make the peanut chutney in bulk and keep it in your fridge to use all the time on avocado toast or anything else. This is the perfect recipe for a beginner to start with, it’s familiar but different at the same time. For the people who can’t seem to drop meat or give vegan and vegetarian food a real chance because they make the assumption that it’s not flavorful, how do you bring out that mouth-watering quality — those umami flavors — into meat and dairy free dishes? Whatever food that’s being cooked, whether vegetarian or vegan, the elements of the food need to have five things between taste and texture: sweetness, saltiness, bitterness, spiciness, and that umami flavor to round it up. You can really only get that by making sure you have varying textures and flavors in your food. When I described the avocado toast, you’ll notice the avocado on it is very buttery and can even be described as mushy because that’s the consistency of avocado. But it’s paired with dry peanut chutney, so it’s slightly crunchy, and the pomegranate on top gives some tartness and bitterness to it that balances out the butteriness and spiciness of the whole dish. Even if you’re used to eating meat if you eat one of my dishes you won’t feel like you aren’t satisfied and need to chew on something meaty because you’re getting that full experience through texture and flavor. Making sure you have varying textures that are complementary to each other makes a very satisfying dish. I’ve converted a lot of carnivores… I’m just saying. What recipe would you recommend for a more seasoned pro in the kitchen? Most of the recipes in my book are not that difficult, that’s my style of cooking because I’m secretly lazy. But a recipe that’s my favorite and I’d say it probably requires less skill but is more an acquired taste, is the Coconut Masala Stuffed Okra. Okra is my favorite vegetable and it gets a lot of hate but if you cook it properly it’s not slimy. This dish takes fresh okra and is split lengthwise and stuffed with a Coconut Masala mixture that’s made with grated coconut, and a bunch of different dried spices ground up and stuffed into the okra and flash fried. Topped with a lot of fresh lemon juice and fresh coriander or cilantro. It’s a different take on okra but it’s something I grew up eating a lot. That’s a recipe someone would enjoy making if they are more adventourous eater. Can you run us through a dish that’s your go-to for convincing meat eaters to give veganism or vegetarian dishes a chance? I have two in my book, one that I think is really fun and one I think is more familiar. The fun one is in my South Indian chapter. The dish is Spiced Rub Cauliflower Steak with Pistachio and Cilantro Gremolata. We’ve all heard of cauliflower steak, very common, but the way this is cooked and how it all comes together is a little unique. I have a huge focus on sustainability so a lot of recipes in my book are low waste or zero waste. With the cauliflower, I’ve not only used the head of the cauliflower but the leaves as well, instead of just discarding them. The leaves get charred and cooked with the cauliflower which adds a really nice textural element to the meatiness of the cauliflower. That kind of helps bring it together with the greenness of the leaves then it’s topped with a pistachio gremolata that has a lot of fresh tomato, coconut, pistachio, and crushed coriander. It adds that tangy and fresh element that helps round out the dish. I’ve made a rendition of this for a lot of my meat-eating friends and if I pair it with a cumin basmati pulao they are basically in heaven. I’m not just saying that, they’ve said that to me! The second dish is a Tamarind Tofu Bánh Mi. I haven’t been to Vietnam yet, it’s on my list, but I’ve had a lot of bánh mis in my life. This Bánh Mi takes into account a lot of familiar Indian elements and it marinates the tofu in tamarind chutney and pairs it with a really spicy vegan aioli with a nice toasted bread and all of the accouterments of the fresh jalapeños and cilantro, carrots and relish. I’ve had a few of my friends test this recipe while I was developing the book, all of them were heavy meat eaters, I intentionally gave them this recipe to test, and they told me they did it with both chicken and tofu and they much preferred the tofu because the texture and flavor was so much better than the chicken because the tofu was able to absorb the marinade better. I wanted to get your take on why its important to incorporate more vegan and vegetarian food into your diet, even if you don’t plan on giving up meat entirely? My mission around this, I’m not telling people “go vegan or I won’t like you” — it’s not like that, but it’s about making more conscious decisions about what you put on your plate. In America, the perspective on food is that it’s a three-pronged plate. A protein at the center, a carb on the side, and a vegetable on the side. They’re both afterthoughts, the protein is the star of the plate. That’s not the way the rest of the world eats, especially not the culture I come from. My hope is that I can get people to think outside of that plate and broaden their perspective and involve vegan and plant-based foods into their life more. One because it’s easy, two because it’s not as expensive as people think, and three because it’s really satisfying and it directly impacts the longevity of our planet. All the recipes in my book all involve ingredients and foods we’ve heard of. There is nothing in this book that isn’t going to be accessible to someone who lives in the middle of America and doesn’t have access to a fancy market like Whole Foods. I want people to realize that you can be really healthy and make really delicious food and help the planet at the same time.
2021-10-28	19:01:07+00:00		The Cat Dad vs. the Vegan	https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/opinion/local-election-mayor.html	As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. Guess I’m going for the vegan. Next week we’ll be voting in local elections all around the country. In New York the big contest is for mayor, and it pits Democrat Eric Adams against Republican Curtis Sliwa. Challenged to say something nice about Adams during the final mayoral debate on Tuesday night, Sliwa praised the Democrat’s vegan diet, adopted during a struggle against diabetes. Adams commended Sliwa on his kindness to animals. Sliwa and his wife are into sheltering abandoned cats, and they currently have 16 in their 320-square-foot studio apartment. I’ve got to admit this is the election factoid that has me most fascinated. The idea of vegan meals being served at Gracie Mansion is sort of interesting — bet we’d get more discussions of the menus than we ever got during Bill de Blasio’s long tenure. But how many cats could you fit in there? Dozens? Hundreds? OK, people — your turn. If you’ve got a mayoral election coming up in your town, tell me one interesting thing about a major candidate. Hey, there’s got to be something. If you’re still mulling, maybe you’re failing to focus. Keep thinking. We’ve still got … days. Do I see a hand over there in Connecticut? Yes, Stamford? You’ve got the former manager of the Mets running? And he called the Democratic candidate “a 35-year-old girl?” Wow, is he promising to make Stamford a municipal version of the Mets? Like residents of many cities, New Yorkers frequently feel as if their November vote is a tad anticlimactic. The real drama came in the Democratic primary — as the winner, Adams now enjoys a certain advantage that comes with being standard-bearer for a party with 3.7 million voters, compared with the Republicans’ 566,000. But we political junkies are hanging on until the bitter end. Still lots to gnaw over. Does everybody know that Sliwa’s been married four times and has two children from a long-running entanglement with the Queens district attorney? Meanwhile, where does Adams, a former police officer running on his promise to reform the city’s law enforcement culture, actually live? Brooklyn? New Jersey? His office? If we’re confused, Adams says it may be the fault of his having employed a homeless man to fill out his tax forms. OK, your turn to complain about your options. Yes, Minneapolis, I see your hand. You’re right: People who live in cities where the choice is basically between two names on the ballot should not be whining near folks who are going to have to pick from — my gosh, did you say 17? Indeed. Minneapolis has 17 candidates for mayor. The poor voters are supposed to go through the whole pile and pick a favorite, a runner-up and a third selection. This is called ranked-choice voting and it’s gotten very popular around the country. As the votes are counted, the biggest losers are tossed off and the people who picked them get their next choice put in the mix. The system has many advantages, but it does add one more responsibility to your good-citizen agenda. I remember being stuck at my Manhattan polling place, trying to imagine who my third-favorite candidate for comptroller might be … The Minneapolis election is theoretically nonpartisan but the candidates are allowed to give themselves a tag. Seven say they’re Democratic Farmer-Labor, which is going to give the voters quite a bit to scramble through, when they aren’t being distracted by the difference between the Independent, Independence Alliance and For the People parties. Or the self-declared nicknames, like Nate “Honey Badger” Atkins and Kevin “No Body” Ward. Another candidate calls himself Bob “Again” Carney Jr. and that’s a great reminder of how many times you’ve gone to vote, looked at the ballot and moaned, “Not again …” So, bottom line: big election doings coming on Tuesday. For your town, for your city and for all those candidates. Winning a job like mayor is certainly an opportunity to serve the community. And maybe it’s a political steppingstone to — what? A. Being elected president B. Being elected mayor again C. Being indicted Well, only three American mayors have ever gone on to the White House, and the last of those was Calvin Coolidge. As far as lengthy tenure goes, lots of towns now have term limits, but for those that don’t, the sky’s the limit. (By the way, feel free to congratulate Robert Blais of Lake George, N.Y., on his 50th anniversary as village mayor. Blais, 85, recently told a local paper that he was leaning heavily toward retirement a couple of years down the line.) On the indictment front, I noticed that a leading candidate for mayor in the upcoming Cincinnati election had his campaign sidetracked when he was charged with accepting bribes last November. Certainly sounds like time for a change, but observers are noting that the Cincinnati electorate seems a little, um, detached. “Does anyone care, including the candidates themselves?” demanded a local columnist. Well, you can understand why the voters might be a tad depressed, given that a third of the City Council has been arrested on charges like bribery and extortion. But really, citizens, this is exactly the time you have to put on your boots and march over to the polling places, demonstrating that you’re paying attention and want to turn things around. Really, it’ll perk up your day. Even if it’s raining. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.

2021-10-27	15:58:07+00:00	Bridie Pearson-jones	High street butchers are thriving despite rise of veganism	https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/food/article-10136023/High-street-butchers-thriving-despite-rise-veganism.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ito=1490&ns_campaign=1490	 Published: 16:38 GMT, 27 October 2021 | Updated: 17:49 GMT, 27 October 2021 Local British butchers are thriving despite the rise of vegan and vegetarianism as people are searching for higher quality meat despite cutting down their overall consumption. Spending on beef, lamb and pork in British butchers jumped by 28 per cent to £338.5 million in 2020 and grew even more in 2021 where sales rose £438million, according to research from Kantar. However, daily meat consumption in the UK has fallen by 17 per cent across the last ten years, with vegan meat imitations thriving at supermarkets and estimated to be worth £1billion to the UK economy. This is likely because middle class Brits now look down on buying meat from the supermarket, with 'boutique butchers' instead the place to go for the best cuts. Paul Grout, the founder of the Meat chain, which has butchers across some of north London's most expensive postcodes believes that people have become more interested in 'provenance and wanting to know where their food comes from'. He told the Times demand went 'absolutely mental' at his Stoke Newington shop during lockdown as locals unable to go to restaurants forked out £13.75 for 250g cuts of fillet steak at £13.75 and £67.50 for 3kg legs of lamb for £67.50. Other butchers, such as HG Walter in west London - that supplies Michelin starred restaurants and Harrods - saw queues around the block despite the number of butchers in the UK falling by 60 per cent to fewer than 5,500 in the last 25 years. John Pallagi, CEO of Farmison & Co an online butcher told FEMAIL: 'Making sure the nation eats better quality produce is something we actually have in common with many of those advocating for plant-based diets. In lockdown, demand not only surged for quality meat with flavour as people looked to recreate the restaurant experience at home, but with that came enthusiasm for the provenance of our meat. 'I've always been adamant that heritage British breeds taste better and that encouraging the public to seek out and eat this meat is a good thing for the environment, and is a true super food. 'We also experienced surges in demand from our customers when we put out educational pieces that to be sustainable, we must reduce waste and eat the whole carcass. Spending on beef, lamb and pork in British butchers jumped by 28 per cent to £338.5 million in 2020 and grew even more in 2021 where sales rose £438million, according to research from Kantar (stock image) 'Customers who suddenly were preparing most of their own meals jumped at the opportunity to try new cuts, in the process helping us to reduce wastage'. Tony Hindhaugh, Director at Parson's Nose butcher, added: 'Covid was a game changer for the high street and especially food retailers. 'Without doubt, scepticism that Covid was man-made and there was a link to animals made customers question the food they were eating. This together with shortages in large supermarkets and concerns about crowds assisted in driving customers back to the high street and shopping local in their communities. 'People working from home has clearly had an impact on sales of meat as work time lunches have fizzled out and families are spending more time together over the dining table. People are more willing to cook for themselves and have a much greater awareness of "you are what you eat". Dr Alona Pulde suggests being mindful about the following everyday items, including coffee, sugar and palm oil, as they also contribute to increased carbon emissions and deforestation. ● Beef and lamb. Consider limiting or eliminating as they are primary contributors to environmental damage. In fact, beef, mutton and milk production contribute 80% of total greenhouse gas emissions amongst livestock6 ● Palm oil. Contributes to deforestation, soil erosion and depletion, natural habitat destruction, and higher carbon emissions ● Farmed fish. Require more wild fish consumption than actual fish production. Their feces contribute to water pollution, while the crowding of fish can breed bacteria and other disease ● Coffee. Increased demand has resulted in production that contributes to deforestation, heavy water usage and runoff that pollutes waterways and destroys natural habitats ● Sugar. Production leads to deforestation and destroys natural habitats. It is water intensive, which erodes the soils and contaminates waterways, damaging sea life ecosystems 'Customers were more interested about where food was coming from and also much more willing to pay a little more to get piece of mind in the provenance and quality of their food. 'The environmental impact of this is massive. Cheap meat is mass-produced, is full of growth hormones and accounts for a considerable amount of harmful gasses in our environment. 'Now that lockdown is easing and things gradually are getting back to normality, the trend has remained and not dropped off. Parson’s Nose sales are still significantly up and the same appetite for knowledge and information about what you eat is still there with the customer. This is good for the trade of butchery and the high street as well as shopping locally and responsibly.' Earlier this month, a study published in the journal The Lancet Planetary Health, revealed that most people are eating less red meat and processed meat than a decade ago. The Oxford-based team found that while there was a 17g daily drop in nationwide daily meat consumption per person, it is not happening quickly enough to meet the National Food Strategy's goal. The goal, which is based on a review of the UK's food system including farming and sustainability, recommended that meat consumption should fall by 30 per cent across the next ten years. Elsewhere, a recent report by Waitrose found middle class Brits are ditching meat and adopting a 'climatarian diet' in a move to reduce their carbon footprint. Dubbed the 'new 5:2 diet' - a reference to a popular weight loss method where people only diet two days a week - eco-conscious Britons are spending five days a week veggie and treating themselves to meat at weekends. But it's not just cutting down meat consumption to be more green, Waitrose shoppers are also looking for other ways to be more eco-friendly with their diets, including minimising food waste by donating excess food and not buying groceries wrapped in excess packaging. Nearly 70 per cent of Waitrose customers said reducing their climate footprint was either 'very' or 'somewhat' important. Meanwhile, Lifesum, the leading global nutrition app has launched a 'climatarian' diet for its users which focuses on reducing the carbon footprint with plant-based, locally sourced produce. It isn't the same as a vegan diet - as it includes eco-friendly meats like chicken - but avoids plants that are environmentally damaging like almonds and avocados. Earlier this year, Countryfile presenter Adam Henson warned of the devastating impact of the fruit on the environment. He said: 'Avocados and almond milk are disastrous for the environment. It isn't a simple argument. 'Beef, sheep and dairy farmers are having fingers pointed at them quite a lot about health and climate change, but the industries are doing a huge amount about that. 'So, I would urge people to eat British food and don't buy cheap food from abroad.' The labour to make avocados is very water intensive - with a kilo of avocados requiring 2000 litres of water to grow. And this, coupled with the Western fascination with the fruit, has led to avocados being linked with water shortages, human rights abuses, illegal deforestation, ecosystem destruction and general environmental devastation in Mexico. Food creates 20-30 per cent of all global carbon emissions. A major component is also reducing animal food consumption, particularly beef, which contributes to higher emissions than plant foods (about 57 per cent compared to 29 per cent) and more than transportation globally 'A Climatarian diet focused on whole plant-based foods, has been shown to reduce the risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, autoimmune diseases and obesity, while increasing overall vitality, mental health and longevity. Some people even notice their skin clears of blemishes or acne - or just looks healthier and younger,' Dr Alona Pulde told FEMAIL. The comments below have not been moderated.

2021-10-27	14:36:55+00:00	Tanyel Mustafa	Adidas reveals first vegan football boots designed by Stella McCartney	https://metro.co.uk/2021/10/27/adidas-reveals-vegan-football-boots-designed-by-stella-mccartney-15495111/	Vegan boots have been all the rage with trendy and eco-conscious consumers for a while – but now the football industry is catching up. Designer Stella McCartney has worked with footballer Paul Pogba and Adidas to launch the brand’s first vegan football boots. Called the Predator Freak boots, they’re made from 100% vegan materials and have part-recycled materials. Earlier this year, the designer debuted a small line of clothing using vegan mushroom leather, making her intentions to go greener with her products known. Here sustainability ties with innovation, as the boots meet both vegan clothing standards and boot performance needs. Manchester United and France midfielder Paul played a key role in the design of the shoes. He was keen to get involved in the joint project started after he and Stella discussed their mutual love for fashion on The Huddle podcast during lockdown last year. Paul, 28, said: ‘I am a footballer first and foremost, but I have a huge interest in fashion and design and I’ve always wanted to explore this further. ‘This collaboration has been particularly special for me because I’ve been a fan of Stella McCartney’s work for a long time, so when we came together for The Huddle last year and had this idea, it felt like the perfect opportunity to create something.’ He plans on wearing them on the pitch to play games. Stella added: ‘Since the start of my collaboration with Adidas, we’ve continued to push the boundaries in high-fashion and performance wear so it’s incredibly exciting to be expanding into the world of football with the superstar athlete Paul Pogba.’ The Predator Freak model is available to buy on Adidas’ website now and in selected stores from November 1.

diet	For an Indian vegetarian, to turn to a vegan diet bereft of dairy products, is only to be imagined.	
diet	An Ipsos Retail Performance survey in March 2020, estimated there were some 9.6 million Americans on a plant-based diet than there were 15 years ago, Vegannewsnow.com reported March 6, 2020.	
diet	Livekindly.co referred to a 2004 survey by Time and CNN which found only 290,000 people in this country were interested in a vegan diet.	
diet	The Oxford Martin School’s Programme on the Future of Food, built several models, and estimated that if a vegan diet was followed globally, it would cut food-related emissions by 70 percent, compared to 63 percent if everyone went vegetarian, and if ‘global dietary guidelines’ were followed, it would reduce only 29 percent.	
diet	“Our analysis indicates that adopting global dietary guidelines would not be enough to reduce food-related greenhouse gas emissions to the same extent that total greenhouse gas emissions will need to fall to keep global temperature increases to below 2°C,” Dr. Marco Springmann, leader of the study, is quoted saying in the press release from Oxford University.	
diet	He says he also started to connect how racial injustice contributes to the poor diet that many African Americans eat.	
diet	Although he does not identify as a vegan, which the Vegan Society defines as an ethical lifestyle choice that eschews all animal products, he says he now eats largely a plant-based diet that consists mainly of vegetables, fruits and legumes.	
diet	But nowhere has the vegan diet taken off more than in the African-American community.	
diet	African Americans have a higher rate of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity and cancer than most other groups, in part because their diet is on average higher in salt and fat and lower in fruits and vegetables, research shows.	
diet	Numerous studies have showed that plant-based diets are associated with a lower-risk of developing chronic conditions.	
diet	The NHS says that a balanced vegan or vegetarian diet can be "very healthy", but notes that it is not the only path to health.	
diet	It cautioned that vegans need to be careful to plan their diet to get adequate protein and calcium through plant-based sources, and may need to take supplements to guard against B12 and iron deficiencies.	
diet	While the diet has been stereotyped as something exclusively for soy-latte swilling, upper-middle class white hipsters, there is a long history of black veganism in the US and abroad, he is quick to point out.	
diet	After battling high-blood pressure as a young man, Mr Adewale was introduced to vegetarianism by his brother, and then later adopted a vegan diet after being introduced to it by members of the Rastafari religion, which emerged in Jamaica in the 1930s.	
diet	Traditional African cuisines, while not strictly vegan, are also largely plant-based and rich in dark leafy greens and legumes - staples in a healthy diet.	
diet	They found that people who eat vegan and vegetarian diets have a lower risk of heart disease, but a higher risk of stroke, possibly partly due to a lack of B12.	
diet	A vegan diet is defined as a way of eating that avoids animal-derived products and ingredients to the best of one’s ability.	
diet	Veganism typically extends beyond diet and also aims to avoid the use of animal-derived ingredients or byproducts that are harvested in ways that may harm animals.	
diet	As honey is often avoided on a vegan diet, you may wonder whether beeswax should also be excluded.	
diet	Furthermore, some people on a vegan diet believe that disrupting beehives without the ability to obtain consent from their owners goes against veganism.	
diet	As Cyrus explained on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast this week, after seven years of following a plant-based diet, wearing exclusively animal-free fashion, and sharing her vegan values with millions of fans, she no longer identifies as vegan, and is now pescatarian.	
diet	We've seen it before: the influencer experiences a health issue, tries a few cures to no avail, tries reintroducing an animal product to her diet, suddenly feels better (very likely a placebo effect), then denounces veganism.	
diet	For example, last year, YouTuber Bonny Rebecca announced she had added eggs and fish back into her once-vegan diet to remedy health issues in a YouTube video titled "Why I'm no longer vegan…"	
diet	In a new study published in Nature Sustainability, researchers say that shifting global consumption away from animal products to a more plant-based diet would free up large areas of land.	
diet	In the study, the researchers saw three possible scenarios for 2050: business-as-usual, where meat consumption remains on its current course of increase; a healthier diet with 70 per cent meat reduction; and a vegan diet.	
diet	If meat consumption follows current economic trends, the business-as-usual diet would see further clearing of ecosystems to make more land space for animal agriculture.	
diet	Whereas the healthier, reduced-meat diet could remove 332 gigatonnes of CO2 – equal to the amount of CO2 produced over the last nine years by burning fossil fuels.	
diet	The vegan diet would remove 16 years’ worth of CO2 emissions from the atmosphere, a total of 547 gigatonnes.	
diet	Soon enough, she quit and swapped to a plant-based diet and started losing weight.	
diet	How sustainable is a vegan diet?	
diet	Pavithra N Raj, chief dietician-nutrition in a Bengaluru hospital, says, “Often vegans have two deficiencies — Vitamin B 12 and D.	
diet	Defined as a healthy route, a vegan diet should include ragi, green leafy vegetables for nutrients.	
diet	“For proteins, one can opt for almond or soya milk, and include sprouts, nuts and dals in the diet.”	
diet	Overindulgence into anything is not good, points out Dr Priyanka Rohatgi, chief clinical dietician in a Bengaluru hospital.	
diet	Nutrition experts suggest that one could opt to be an ‘over vegan’, which means the individual takes a break from the vegan diet and consumes eggs in between.	
diet	The commercial was conceived by international charity Vegan Friendly, whose mission is to promote plant-based diets in order to stop animal cruelty and slow down climate change.	
diet	The country’s affinity for vegan cuisine, and the widespread availability of plant-based dishes, is likely related to Judaism’s strict dietary laws for keeping kosher.	
diet	“Unique to this newly formed country is the mix of the traditional Mediterranean diet of the area and the strict dietary laws of kosher food – the separation of meat, dairy, and pareve, which is pretty much vegan apart from the fish gelatin and honey, which means it has been easy to embrace veganism,” explains Chef’s Pencil.	
diet	With fears over contaminated poultry on the rise, here are 7 ways you can easily transition to a vegan diet.	
diet	Shockingly, in a nation viewed as distinctly developed, people’s diets remain depauperate and their nutrition poor.	
diet	These issues are entirely distinct from those surrounding diet choice; they are issues of food insecurity where individuals are stripped of all choice.	
diet	As a student this is relatively simple; as a household with a mish-mash of diet preferences, it’s most certainly not.	
diet	I do contest that this is the major driving force preventing radical diet shifts.	
diet	When delving into the depths of vegan culture, it’s important to assess where the motives for such a radical diet change might stem from.	
diet	Considering the marked prevalence of admired female celebrities who publicly adopt a vegan diet (Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Ellen DeGeneres to name a few), this is a given.	
diet	While society is more accommodating of dietary restrictions than ever, it can still be costly to maintain a balanced and nutritious vegan diet.	
diet	However, vegan diets do require dedication.	
diet	While being vegan can be affordable, this doesn’t offset the fact that some degree of budgetary flexibility is needed to successfully maintain a plant-based diet.	
diet	There’s no shortage of celebrities, professional athletes and influencers who are strong proponents of a plant-based diet.	
diet	Even for the everyday herbivore, dedication, time and research are needed to ensure you are getting all of the supplements and nutrients needed for a healthy diet.	
diet	A few years ago, LeBron James made headlines for following an extremely strict paleo diet –– cutting out sugar, carbs and dairy entirely and subsisting solely on meat, fish, fruits and vegetables –– and losing a drastic amount of weight.	
diet	He had resources that the average health-conscious consumer does not — private trainers, nutritionists and chefs to provide him with the knowledge and nutrients needed to conduct a drastic diet change and still maintain his superhuman fitness and athleticism.	
diet	In most instances, it can be extremely unhealthy and unsafe to cut entire food groups out of your diet.	
diet	Those with underlying health issues, allergies and dietary restrictions and those recovering from eating disorders may not necessarily benefit from a restrictive diet like veganism.	
diet	All this is not to say that being vegan can’t be a healthy, family-friendly diet, but there are several crucial caveats to consider when contemplating a switch to veganism.	
diet	In a recent interview with podcaster Joe Rogan, Miley Cyrus revealed that she has officially forsaken the title of vegan, and in 2019 added fish to her diet, and now considers herself pescetarian.	
diet	After Rogan warned that her vegan fans were going to be upset, the 27-year-old defended her new diet, saying, "Listen, I give home, I have 22 animals on my farm in Nashville, I've got 22 in my house in Calabasas like I'm doing what I need to do for the animals, okay?	
diet	Scientific evidence seems to refute Cyrus' claims of improved brain function after ditching a vegan diet.	
diet	A study that followed nearly one thousand participants for five years assessing their brain function and concluded that a diet heaviest in leafy greens was most brain-healthy.	
diet	A vegan diet rich in whole foods would fit the bill.	
diet	Dr. Matthew Nagra, ND, took to Instagram to comment on Cyrus' recent transition back into eating some animal product, suggesting that a placebo effect may have caused the star to feel improved cognitive function, "Something that should give pause is when someone notices drastic improvements with a small dietary change.	
diet	"This becomes even more likely when a vegan has constantly been told that their diet is deficient by those who clearly have not seen the data.	
diet	According to Cyrus, she had to incorporate fish into her diet because her brain wasn’t functioning properly.	
diet	If she wasn’t getting her omega 3s through either algae supplements (where the fish themselves get it from) or a balanced vegan diet, her brain health would have been suffering.	
diet	The tabloids have been jumping on the bandwagon with snarky comments about malnutrition, and even my friendship group (where vegans are very much the minority) are discussing how it was bound to happen if you ‘restrict your diet so much.’	
diet	Ex-vegan Miley Cyrus says it is 'over the top' for vegans to be 'so invested in other people's diets'.	
diet	The celebrity recently revealed that she has ditched her vegan diet and now eats fish while appearing on a recent episode of Joe Rogan's podcast.	
diet	"When I was vegan I was really worried about other people's diets and really judgey... it's a little over the top to be so invested in other people's diets," she said.	
diet	Despite Cyrus' claims about a vegan diet and brain function, ND Dr. Matthew Nagra has spoken out about how 'fatigue (mental or physical) can be caused by a myriad of issues, which may not be diet-related, and there’s no indication that she was seeking any medical care'.	
diet	He added: "Something that should give pause is when someone notices drastic improvements with a small dietary change.	
diet	"This becomes even more likely when a vegan has constantly been told that their diet is deficient by those who clearly have not seen the data.	
diet	As athletes often rely on a protein-heavy diet, the myth that high-level sportspeople need to consume animal products to succeed has persisted for decades.	
diet	What you may not know is that the Spaniard follows an entirely plant-based diet to fuel his training.	
diet	Now following a fully plant-based diet, the footballer is keen to dispel the belief that athletes need meat and animal products to succeed.	
diet	His diet, therefore, needs to contain all the essential proteins for muscle recovery, along with enough calories to maintain energy levels throughout the week.	
diet	I ask Saúl what his teammates think of his plant-based diet, particularly as I spot Heura cropping up on other players’ social media channels too.	
diet	“The truth is that many follow my diet because it grabs their attention, and then they eat my food - and they feel good eating my food!	
diet	Saúl is keen to highlight though, that a vegan diet isn’t automatically healthy.	
diet	People can’t just ditch animal products and assume their food is good - in order to feel the true benefits, a plant-based diet needs to be holistic, balanced, and genuinely healthy.	
diet	One, so to speak, is a diet.	
diet	One of the criticisms often levelled at high-profile celebrities on plant-based diets is that this lifestyle is only afforded to the wealthy and privileged.	
diet	Although there are definite environmental benefits, there are also all kinds of completely valid reasons to not follow a vegan diet.	
diet	Not to mention the various cultural and financial reasons a vegan diet might not work for your lifestyle.	
diet	One really fun way to promote veganism without changing diet is by shifting your beauty routine to vegan and cruelty-free products.	
diet	Whether you follow a full vegan diet or not, these are great ways to supplement and create a healthier environment, for our animals and ourselves.	
diet	Here are twenty athletes who credit switching to a vegan or plant-based diet with improving their fitness and results-- through faster recovery time between workouts, quicker healing from injury, and being able to build leaner, stronger muscles.	
diet	These superstars say that their diets helped them get to where they are today, such as preparing for Olympic Gold or becoming the number one tennis player in the world.	
diet	These champion players report that eating a plant-based diet increases energy levels, provides more than enough clean protein to refuel and rebuild, reduces inflammation, and improves recovery time.	
diet	Before changing his diet, Djokovic had searched for cures to the breathing issues that cost him matches and focus which caused him to struggled during his most intense matches.	
diet	Tia Blanco won gold at the International Surfing Association Open in 2015 and credits her success to her vegan diet.	
diet	Blanco reports that a vegan diet helps her stay strong and she enjoys eating different forms of vegan protein like nuts, seeds, beans, and legumes.	
diet	The seven-time Grand Slam singles champion recovers faster on a plant-based diet now, compared to how she felt back when she ate animal protein.

diet	The Beet reported on Willaim's diet and what she normally eats in a day to stay healthy, fit, and win more matches.	
diet	Mike Tyson recently said he is "in the best shape ever" thanks to his vegan diet.	
diet	In an exclusive interview with The Beet's Awesome Vegans columnist Elysabeth Alfano, Paul said eating a plant-based diet helps him keep up with players half his age.	
diet	The Beet recently reported on how this dietary switch has allowed Kaepernick to stay strong and healthy.

diet	The Beet recently interviewed Frazier about his vegan journey and how to be a successful athlete on a plant-based diet.	
diet	If it’s done right, [plant-based diets] can really help you recover faster."	
diet	Many cite health reasons for following a plant-based diet, as well as concerns about the inhumane conditions at factory farms, responsible for 90% of the global meat supply, per the Sentience Institute.	
diet	This causes many to fear they may be getting the wrong type or quantity of protein when following a vegetarian or vegan diet.	
diet	In practical terms, this means that following a diet providing too little of either food group may cause you to get insufficient amounts of essential amino acids.	
diet	Many people believe that due to vegetarian and vegan diets’ low content of animal-based protein, they often lack sufficient amounts of “complete” protein.	
diet	Currently, there’s no evidence of protein deficiency among vegetarians or vegans, except perhaps in the small percentage who eat too few calories or follow monotonous or restricted eating patterns, such as fruitarian or potato-based diets (3).	
diet	That said, the current evidence suggests that this difference in absorption is likely too minimal to cause vegetarians or vegans to get insufficient amounts of essential amino acids from their diet (3).	
diet	In short, as long as a plant-based diet remains rich enough in calories and offers a good variety of protein sources, there’s little reason to worry about getting too little “complete” protein on a vegetarian or vegan diet.	
diet	Vegetarians and vegans should have little difficulty getting enough “complete” protein from their diet — that is, as long as it remains varied and rich enough in calories.	
diet	This causes most plant foods to be viewed as “incomplete” proteins, perpetuating the myth that plant-based diets may not offer the right amount or type of protein.	
diet	That said, as long as a plant-based diet contains a good variety of food groups and enough calories, there’s little reason for vegetarians or vegans to worry about “complete” or “incomplete” proteins.	
diet	If you’re losing weight or lack energy, consult a medical professional or registered dietitian.	
diet	People who follow a plant-based diet swear that it is indeed a way of living that excludes all forms of animal products.	
diet	When asked to define veganism, Palak said, “There is a popular misconception, that veganism is a diet.	
diet	Although most people start by following a vegan diet, it extends to one's lifestyle choices as well.	
diet	According to Cowspiracy, animal agriculture is responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, more than the combined exhaust from all transportation and a plant-based diet cuts your carbon emissions by 50 percent.	
diet	Talking about animal products, Palak explained, “A vegetarian diet is based on a false premise.	
diet	A sumptuous Indian diet tends to include milk, ‘ghee’, ‘dahi’, and ‘paneer’.	
diet	Karyn’s Raw opened in 2000 in Lincoln Park, and Calabrese quickly became a star as she touted her diet and upscale lifestyle.	
diet	“I said to my husband I’m changing my diet and he said ‘What?’,” Medley recalled.	
diet	“My mom would make conventional staples of the American diet, like mac and cheese — only vegan.	
diet	Almost every vegetarian and vegan cookbook focuses on the whole wheat/kefir/green cleanse/salt lamp/lentil aspect of living a cruelty-free diet.	
diet	Vegan diets — which exclude all foods of animal origin — were already increasing in popularity, whether for health, ethical or environmental reasons before 2020.	
diet	One misconception is that the people who follow this admittedly restrictive diet have an eating disorder.	
diet	“I come across the stereotype about vegans having eating disorders more so among my fellow health-care professionals than I do the public,” said Chicago-based vegan registered dietitian Taylor Wolfram.	
diet	This is a big problem, because when someone who follows a vegan diet is rejected for treatment, it’s an average of two years before they try to seek help again, said Tammy Beasley, vice president of clinical nutrition services for Alsana Eating Disorder Treatment & Eating Recovery Centers.	
diet	Beasley said that before she dug into the research, she had the same biases against vegan diets as many in the eating disorder field.	
diet	The researchers also used dietary assessment tools that weren’t designed for use with vegetarians.	
diet	“I think that often people think that vegan diets and vegans are more ‘extreme’ than they really are,” said Seattle-based registered dietitian Ginger Hultin, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and owner of Champagne Nutrition.	
diet	“The majority of vegans and vegetarians likely have healthful, balanced diets that meet their needs.”	
diet	When Beasley recently informally surveyed fellow dietitians who specialize in eating disorders, 98 percent were seeing eating disorder clients who were also vegan.	
diet	But more than 90 percent of those clients started following a vegan diet after they developed an eating disorder.	
diet	Two recent studies on vegan diets and orthorexia — an unhealthy obsession with eating healthy — contradicted each other.	
diet	One found that vegan diets were associated with orthorexia, but the other did not; the authors in the second study concluded this was probably because most people pursuing veganism do so for ethical, rather than dietary, reasons.	
diet	“Unfortunately, even if someone is vegan for ethical reasons, they're still vulnerable to diet culture just like someone who isn’t vegan,” she said.	
diet	Of course, as the dietitians interviewed point out, any type of diet or “lifestyle plan” that eliminates entire food groups — not just veganism — may increase the risk of an eating disorder in someone who is susceptible because of genetics and social environment.	
diet	This includes ketogenic, Whole 30, paleo and many other popular diets.	
diet	“If you’re on any type of self-restricted diet, one that’s not medically indicated or necessary for a health condition, and you’re feeling socially isolated, you can’t eat out with friends or you spend a large amount of time prepping food, thinking about food or obsessing over food, then it might not be working for you,” Hultin said.	
diet	“Any diet can be unhealthy if it’s interfering with your quality of life.”	
diet	Dennett is a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition by Carrie.	
diet	The sugar in fruit doesn’t make it bad for you, despite some trendy diet claims	
diet	The study added: “Animal product free diets, therefore, deliver greater environmental benefits than purchasing sustainable meat or dairy.”	
diet	The Western diet and lifestyle are often viewed as two of the main contributors to rapid aging and disease.	
diet	Thus, many people wonder whether alternative diets, such as the vegan diet, help people live longer, healthier lives.	
diet	The vegan diet is linked to a range of health benefits, including a lower risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and heart disease (1, 2, 3).	
diet	Research examining the link between plant-based diets and longevity has produced mixed results.	
diet	The Seventh Day Adventist diet is typically plant-based, rich in whole foods, and free of alcohol and caffeine — although some may incorporate small amounts of eggs, dairy, or meat.	
diet	When separated from the rest, vegans had a 15% lower risk of dying prematurely from all causes, indicating that a vegan diet may indeed help people live longer than those who adhere to vegetarian or omnivorous eating patterns (5).	
diet	Furthermore, most studies group vegetarians and vegans together, making it difficult to determine the exact effects of each diet on a person’s life expectancy.	
diet	Therefore, more research is needed solely on vegan diets before strong conclusions can be made.	
diet	Some scientific reviews suggest that vegetarian and vegan diets may help people live longer, but these findings aren’t universal.	
diet	Researchers theorize that vegans who live longer than average tend to do so for two main reasons involving both diet and lifestyle.	
diet	This usually results in a diet that’s rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds (8).	
diet	Research suggests that diets loaded with these plant foods may help people live longer.	
diet	The same can be said about diets low in red and processed meats (9, 10, 11, 12, 13).	
diet	Moreover, vegan diets tend to pack plenty of fiber, plant protein, and antioxidants (5, 14, 15, 16).	
diet	Vegan diets tend to be rich in nutrients that may protect against illnesses and boost your lifespan.	
diet	It’s important to remember that not all vegan diets are rich in nutrients.	
diet	Notably, studies that rate plant-based diets based on their relative amounts of processed versus nutritious foods suggest that only robust, well-planned plant-based diets are linked to an extended lifespan and lower risk of disease (1, 21, 22).	
diet	A healthy vegan diet is typically defined as one that’s rich in minimally processed plant foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, with very few processed junk foods.	
diet	Meanwhile, a poorly planned vegan diet may rely heavily on sweets, processed items, and other foods that are technically vegan but very poor in nutrients.	
diet	For instance, one study claims that plant-based diets as a whole may lower your risk of dying from heart disease by 8%.	
diet	However, nutritious plant-based diets lower this risk by 25% — while unhealthy ones increase it by 32% (21).	
diet	Another suggests that improving the quality of a plant-based diet over 12-years may reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely by 10%.	
diet	However, few studies directly compare the effects of healthy or unhealthy vegan diets to healthy or unhealthy omnivorous ones.	
diet	Poorly planned vegan diets likely don’t offer the same health benefits as nutritious versions of the diet.	
diet	Nutrient-poor vegan diets may even lower your life expectancy.	
diet	Vegan diets are linked to numerous health benefits, including a lower risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and heart disease.	
diet	Yet, like most diets, vegan diets vary in quality.	
diet	If you’re vegan and looking to maximize any longevity-promoting effects, replace processed foods in your diet with whole plant foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds.

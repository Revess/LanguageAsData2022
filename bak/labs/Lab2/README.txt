This is the code for Lab 2 of the course Language as Data 2020, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 
It should only be used for the purpose of the course and not be re-distributed. 

Author: Lisa Beinborn

Structure: 
- All the labs can be found in the folder code. Start with Lab2.1-Processing.ipynb.
- The folder data contains a small extract of the acl-anthology. Load the full acl anthology from https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/anthology.bib.gz
- The results folder can be used to store the crawled data. I already provide a folder structure. Feel free to modify or add folders. Make sure to adjust the paths in the code accordingly.
